Hi my name is Kelly Richardson and I am developer. I graduated with doubled degrees in education and social studies with minors in Political Science and Management Information Systems. 
I started programing as a hobby in middle school. 
For the past 3 years have been programing for the education company I also teach at. I develop applications used by teachers to make their lives easier. 
In 2019 I plan on expanding my portfolio with more diverse projects and will be explaining those projects here in an easy to understand manner.
I believe if you can't explain complex ideas in a way 7th grader can understand, you probably haven't mastered the material well enough.
